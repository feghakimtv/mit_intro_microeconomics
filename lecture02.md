**Module 2: Consumer Preferences and Utility Function**



This module begins our exploration into the origins of the **demand curve**. In previous discussions, demand curves were simply introduced; now, we will delve into the underlying principles of **consumer behavior** that give rise to them. The core idea is to understand how consumers make decisions, specifically **constrained choices**. Consumers aim to make themselves **as well off as possible, subject to a limited budget**.



Our first step, however, is to set aside the concept of a limited budget entirely. We will initially focus solely on **what consumers want** – their **preferences** – without considering their ability to pay. This leads us to the first step in deriving consumer demand: writing down assumptions about consumer preferences.



Ultimately, the process of deriving consumer demand will involve three main steps:

1. Stating the underlying assumptions or axioms about **consumer preferences** across goods.

2. Translating these axioms into a mathematical representation known as a **utility function**.

3. Introducing the **budget constraint** and analyzing how consumers make choices given their utility function and budget.



Today, we focus on the first two steps: preferences, the axioms that govern them, and their translation into a mathematical utility function.



**Consumer Preferences: Key Assumptions**



To model consumer preferences, we make simplifying assumptions, as is common in economic models. For consumer preferences regarding goods, three key assumptions are made:



1. **Completeness:** Consumers are assumed to have an opinion about any two choices presented to them. When faced with choice A and choice B, a consumer will either prefer A to B, prefer B to A, or be indifferent between the two. They will not say, "I don't know". This means consumers have opinions over all possible choices, leading to a complete set of preferences.

2. **Transitivity:** This is a standard mathematical assumption. If a consumer prefers choice A to choice B, and prefers choice B to choice C, then they must prefer choice A to choice C.

3. **Non-satiation (More is always better):** This assumption is particularly powerful in economics. It states that, for **goods**, having more of something is always better than having less. It does not mean that each additional unit makes you equally happy, but simply that receiving something for free would always be taken because it's better than not having it. This assumption applies when dealing with "goods," not "bads" (like being poked in the eye with a needle). In this framework, we operate exclusively in a world of goods.



These assumptions are fundamental to the theory of consumer preferences. Preferences themselves are generally taken as primitive in this context; we don't question *where* preferences come from (genetics, environment, etc.), but accept them as given.



**Indifference Curves: Mapping Preferences**



Based on these assumptions, we can develop **indifference curves**, which are graphical representations or "preference maps". Indifference curves map a consumer's preferences across different combinations of goods.



Consider a simple example with two goods: slices of pizza (S) and cookies (C). Imagine three choices:

* Choice A: 2 slices of pizza, 1 cookie.

* Choice B: 1 slice of pizza, 2 cookies.

* Choice C: 2 slices of pizza, 2 cookies.



If a consumer is indifferent between Choice A and Choice B, but prefers Choice C to both A and B, this can be mapped graphically. With cookies on the x-axis and slices of pizza on the y-axis:

* Points A and B lie on the same **indifference curve** because the consumer is indifferent between these combinations. An indifference curve connects all combinations of goods that yield the same level of satisfaction or utility.

* Point C lies on a **higher indifference curve** because the consumer prefers Choice C.



**Properties of Indifference Curves**



Indifference curves have four key properties that follow from our assumptions about preferences:



1. **Consumers prefer higher indifference curves:** Curves further away from the origin represent higher quantities of goods (assuming both are goods), and thus, according to non-satiation, are more preferred.

2. **Indifference curves are downward sloping:** This property also follows from non-satiation. If an indifference curve were upward sloping, it would mean a consumer is indifferent between a combination with less of both goods and a combination with more of both goods, which violates the assumption that more is always better. To maintain the same level of utility when gaining more of one good, a consumer must give up some of the other good, resulting in a downward slope.

3. **Indifference curves never cross:** If two indifference curves were to cross, it would violate both transitivity and non-satiation. If point A and point B are on one curve (meaning indifference between A and B), and point A and point C are on another curve (meaning indifference between A and C), then by transitivity, the consumer should be indifferent between B and C. However, if point B contains more of both goods than point C, this would contradict non-satiation, as the consumer should prefer B to C.

4. **Only one indifference curve passes through any given point:** Every unique combination of goods corresponds to a single, specific level of preference, meaning it lies on exactly one indifference curve. This is effectively similar to the "never crossing" property and relates to the completeness assumption.



An example demonstrating the use of indifference curves involves a graduate student choosing between job offers based on "school quality" and "location/weather". The student might be indifferent between a high-quality school with mediocre weather (e.g., Princeton) and a lower-quality school with great weather (e.g., Santa Cruz). Both points would lie on the same indifference curve. A different offer (e.g., IMF in DC) might offer a combination of quality and weather that places it on a higher indifference curve, indicating it is preferred. This illustrates how individual preferences, which are neither right nor wrong, can be mapped using indifference curves. More complex choices or additional factors like quality within a good (e.g., a $6 cookie vs. six $1 cookies) can often be broken down into sequential, two-dimensional decisions or mapped in multi-dimensional space.



**Utility Function: Mathematical Representation**



The concept of **utility** provides a mathematical framework for representing preferences and indifference curves. A **utility function** is a mathematical expression of consumer preferences.



A common example of a utility function used is the logarithmic or power form, such as:

**Utility = √(S * C)**

Where S is the quantity of pizza slices and C is the quantity of cookies.



This function is consistent with the earlier example:

* Choice A (2 Slices, 1 Cookie): Utility = √(2 * 1) = √2.

* Choice B (1 Slice, 2 Cookies): Utility = √(1 * 2) = √2.

* Choice C (2 Slices, 2 Cookies): Utility = √(2 * 2) = √4 = 2.

Since √2 is approximately 1.414, Choices A and B yield the same utility (√2), meaning the consumer is indifferent between them. Choice C yields a higher utility (2), meaning it is preferred to A and B. This matches the indifference map described earlier.



**Cardinal vs. Ordinal Utility**



It is crucial to understand that **utility is ordinal, not cardinal**. This means the specific numerical value of utility (e.g., Utility = 2) is meaningless in itself; it only serves to rank choices. A utility of 4 does not necessarily mean a choice is twice as good as a choice with utility 2; it simply means the choice with utility 4 is preferred to the one with utility 2. Utility functions are mappings used *only* for ranking choices.



Because utility is ordinal, many different mathematical functions can represent the same set of preferences as long as they maintain the same ranking of choices. For example, U = S * C or U = (S * C)² would also represent the same rankings as U = √(S * C) for positive values of S and C.



However, the *form* of the utility function matters because it can capture important real-world phenomena, particularly related to **marginal utility**.



**Marginal Utility and Diminishing Marginal Utility**



**Marginal utility (MU)** is the additional utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good. The **fundamental driver** of consumer decisions in this framework is the assumption of **diminishing marginal utility (DMU)**.



**Diminishing marginal utility** assumes that while more is better, the additional utility gained from each successive unit of a good is smaller than the utility gained from the previous unit. The 10th slice of pizza makes you less happy than the 9th slice, and the 5th cookie makes you less happy than the 4th cookie. This is considered a highly sensible assumption for most goods.



Mathematically, while total utility is a positive function of quantity (more goods usually mean higher utility), **marginal utility is typically a decreasing function of quantity**. As you consume more of a good, the *additional* happiness from the next unit falls.



Using the example U = √(S * C) and holding the quantity of one good constant (e.g., 2 slices of pizza), we can see DMU for the other good (cookies):

* With 1 cookie: Utility = √(2 * 1) = √2 ≈ 1.414.

* With 2 cookies: Utility = √(2 * 2) = 2. (Gain in utility: 2 - 1.414 = 0.586)

* With 3 cookies: Utility = √(2 * 3) = √6 ≈ 2.449. (Gain in utility: 2.449 - 2 = 0.449)

The incremental utility from each additional cookie is indeed falling (0.586 > 0.449), illustrating diminishing marginal utility.



DMU is consistent with non-satiation. Non-satiation states that more of *everything* is better. DMU relates to the additional value of successive units of a *single* good, holding others constant. For example, having more right shoes when you only have one left shoe doesn't increase your total utility, but having more left and right shoes *together* does increase utility, which is consistent with non-satiation.



**Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**



The **slope of the indifference curve** represents the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another while remaining on the same indifference curve (i.e., maintaining the same level of utility). This rate of trade-off is called the **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**. Conventionally, it is defined as the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade the good on the y-axis for the good on the x-axis (ΔS / ΔC in our pizza/cookie example).



Although we haven't introduced the budget constraint yet, this trade-off is relevant because, given a limited budget, spending money on one good means less money is available for the other. So, buying one good effectively involves substituting away from the other.



There is a direct relationship between the MRS and marginal utilities. An incremental movement along an indifference curve means the loss in utility from giving up some amount of the y-axis good (ΔS * MUs) must be equal to the gain in utility from getting some amount of the x-axis good (ΔC * MUc).

ΔS * MUs = - ΔC * MUc

Rearranging this gives the slope of the indifference curve (ΔS / ΔC), which is the MRS:

**MRS = - MUc / MUs**



The **MRS is the negative ratio of the marginal utilities**. The negative sign is necessary because indifference curves are downward sloping, while marginal utilities are typically positive (though diminishing). The MRS itself is usually discussed in terms of its absolute value, representing the rate of exchange.



**MRS and the Shape of Indifference Curves**



The shape of the indifference curve, specifically its **convexity** to the origin, is driven by the principle of a **diminishing marginal rate of substitution**. Diminishing MRS means that as a consumer gets more of the good on the x-axis (cookies) and less of the good on the y-axis (pizza) while staying on the same indifference curve, the amount of the y-axis good they are willing to give up to get one more unit of the x-axis good decreases.



Mathematically, using U = √(S * C), we found the MRS = -S/C.

Let's examine the MRS at different points on an indifference curve where utility is 2 (e.g., the curve passing through A, B, C from the example, noting the specific points used in the lecture's graph might differ slightly for illustration):

* Point A (e.g., 4 slices, 1 cookie): MRS = -4/1 = -4. The consumer is willing to give up 4 slices of pizza for one more cookie. This is because they have a lot of pizza (relative to cookies) and the marginal utility of another cookie is high for them at this point.

* Point B (e.g., 2 slices, 2 cookies): MRS = -2/2 = -1. The consumer is willing to trade 1 slice for 1 cookie.

* Point C (e.g., 1 slice, 4 cookies): MRS = -1/4. The consumer is only willing to give up 1/4 of a slice of pizza for one more cookie. This is because they now have many cookies and fewer slices of pizza; the marginal utility of pizza is higher, and the marginal utility of cookies is lower for them at this point.



As we move down the indifference curve (getting more cookies, giving up pizza), the absolute value of the MRS falls (from 4 to 1 to 1/4). This **diminishing MRS** reflects the fact that the more you have of one good (cookies), the less valuable an additional unit of that good becomes relative to the good you have less of (pizza). This results in indifference curves that are **convex to the origin**.



**Concave Indifference Curves**



While mathematically possible, **concave** indifference curves (bowed away from the origin) do not represent the typical consumer preferences captured by diminishing MRS. A utility function like U = S² + C² = constant would produce concave indifference curves. With concave curves, as you get *less* of one good, you would be willing to give up *more* of the other good to get an additional unit of the scarce good, which runs counter to the common sense principle of diminishing marginal utility/MRS. Although such preferences *could* theoretically exist for some individuals, the vast majority of consumer behavior is explained by convex preferences, which assume diminishing MRS.



**Real-World Application: Pricing of Goods**



The principle of **diminishing marginal utility** and the resulting **diminishing marginal rate of substitution** help explain real-world pricing phenomena, such as why larger sizes of consumer goods are often priced at a lower per-unit cost. For example, at Starbucks or McDonald's, doubling the amount of coffee or soda costs significantly less than doubling the price. This is because companies understand that the consumer's **willingness to pay** for the additional quantity diminishes. The first serving satisfies most of the initial intense need; subsequent servings provide less additional satisfaction, and thus consumers are willing to pay less for them. Businesses price this way because they recognize that most people's preferences exhibit diminishing marginal utility/MRS. Their pricing decisions reflect their knowledge of these fundamental consumer preferences, allowing them to maximize sales or revenue by catering to the lower willingness to pay for marginal units.



This concludes our initial look at consumer preferences and utility functions, laying the groundwork for understanding consumer decision-making. Our next step will be to incorporate the **budget constraint** to see how consumers make choices when faced with limited resources.
