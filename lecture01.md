**Principles of Microeconomics (Course 14.01)**

This course, 14.01, is an introduction to **microeconomics**. It features a distinct **policy angle**, aiming to use economics to think intelligently about problems faced by policymakers. Professor Jonathan Gruber is the instructor.

Key points about the teaching style include:
*   Not everything is written on the board; students need to pay attention and listen.
*   The professor talks fast and has bad handwriting, so students should not hesitate to ask for clarification. Asking questions is encouraged and is considered a **public good** because it helps others who may have the same confusion. Lack of class participation is a common issue.
*   The term 'guys' is often used in a gender-neutral sense to refer to economic agents or people.

**What is Microeconomics?**

Fundamentally, microeconomics is the study of **how individuals and firms make themselves as well off as possible in a world of scarcity**. **Scarcity is key**. Because resources are limited, individuals and firms face trade-offs in their decisions. The core concept is **constrained optimization**, which involves assessing these trade-offs and deciding the best action given limited resources. Microeconomics is really about trade-offs and recognizing that "you can't have it all".

**Opportunity Cost**

One of the most important concepts in economics, which will be mentioned frequently, is **opportunity cost**. Opportunity cost is the idea that every action (or inaction) has a cost in terms of the **next best opportunity** that was forgone.
*   For example, if you buy a shirt, the opportunity cost is the other things you could have bought with that money.
*   If you spend all night studying, the opportunity cost is the opportunity to do something else, like go to a concert.
Every decision involves a trade-off because there is always an opportunity cost.

This concept helps explain why economics is sometimes called the **dismal science**. Economists point out that seemingly "free" actions, like watching TV, actually have an opportunity cost because you are giving up other things you could have done.

**Models in Economics**

Economics uses **models** to understand and explain the world. A model is technically a description of any relationship between two or more variables. Unlike natural sciences, economics is a **social science** and does not have rigid, universally applicable scientific laws or constants. Therefore, models are used to explain the world as much as possible.

Building economic models involves making **simplifying assumptions**. These assumptions help trade off two goals: explaining as much as possible, and having models that are parsimonious (simple enough to teach and solve). For instance, models might initially assume only two goods are being traded off, even though reality is more complex; this simplification makes the math easier while providing essential intuition. Some simplifying assumptions may seem "noxious and offensive," but examining what happens without them is key to further study in economics. The statistician George Box is quoted as saying, "**All models are wrong, but some are useful**".

Learning economics involves understanding concepts on three levels: **mathematical, graphical, and intuitive**. Succeeding in the class requires understanding all three.

**The Supply and Demand Model**

The course begins with the **model of supply and demand**, which was the very first economic model developed by Adam Smith in 1776 in his book *The Wealth of Nations*. Adam Smith posed the question of why water, essential for life, is cheap, while diamonds, less essential, are expensive. He realized that the price is determined by both **demand** and **supply**, not just demand alone. While the demand for water is much higher than for diamonds, the supply of water is even greater relative to the supply of diamonds, leading to a lower price for water.

The model uses the concept of a **market**, which is a place where buyers and sellers come together to make transactions. While modern markets aren't always physical places, the intuitive idea of buyers and sellers interacting is still relevant. The market for roses is used as an example. Graphs for this model are typically provided on handouts.

On the standard graph for the supply and demand model:
*   The x-axis (horizontal) represents the **quantity** of goods.
*   The y-axis (vertical) represents the **price** of goods.

The **demand curve** represents the relationship between price and quantity from the **consumer's perspective**.
*   It typically shows a **negative relationship** between price and quantity: as price goes up, consumers want fewer goods.
*   This results in a **downward sloping demand curve**.
*   This relationship is explained by **opportunity cost**: a higher price means a higher opportunity cost (more given up), making consumers want less of the good.

The **supply curve** represents the relationship between price and quantity from the **supplier's perspective**.
*   It typically shows a **positive relationship** between price and quantity: as price goes up, suppliers will produce more goods.
*   This results in an **upward sloping supply curve**.
*   This relationship is also explained by **opportunity cost**: a higher price makes producing the good a better choice than the next best alternative use of resources.

The point where the supply and demand curves meet is called the **equilibrium**.
*   This is the point where supply and demand are in agreement.
*   At equilibrium, suppliers are willing to sell the same quantity of goods at the same price that consumers are willing to pay.
*   It is the point where the system has come to rest, and both parties are "happy" with the outcome.
*   Graphically, this is the intersection point; mathematically, it is found by setting the demand and supply equations equal to each other and solving for the quantity and price (e.g., Q* = 600, P* = $3 in the rose example).

Later lectures will delve deeper into deriving these demand and supply curves from fundamental principles of consumer preferences and firm decisions.

**Positive vs. Normative Economics**

An important distinction in economics is between **positive economics** and **normative economics**.
*   **Positive economics** is the study of the way things **are**.
*   **Normative economics** is the study of the way things **should be**.

The example of a kidney being auctioned on eBay illustrates this distinction. The bidding for a kidney reached $5 million before eBay stopped the auction.
*   A **positive economic question** is: Why did the price get so high? The answer, using the supply and demand model, is due to very high demand (people needing a kidney to live) and very low supply (few kidneys available on the market).
*   A **normative economic question** is: Should we be allowed to sell bodily organs on eBay? This is fundamentally an economics question, even though it might seem philosophical.

Standard economics often favors allowing free markets. Basic economics suggests the market knows best. However, there are reasons why economists might argue against a free market outcome, such as allowing the sale of organs. These reasons fall into two main categories:

1.  **Market failures**: Situations where the market is not working properly. In the organ market example, this could include people being forced to sell their organs, or sellers being misinformed about the health risks of donating a kidney. The existence of a black market itself is not necessarily a market failure reason unless it involves these other unsavory features like coercion or lack of information.
2.  **Equity or fairness**: Concern that the market outcome is unfair. Allowing organs to be sold means that primarily rich people would be able to buy them, which many view as blatantly unfair – rich people could live longer by buying body parts off poor people. While the course will focus heavily on efficiency (whether the market delivers the "right" quantity of goods), equity (whether that quantity leads to large inequality) is also a crucial consideration, though discussed less initially.

**Economic Systems: Capitalist vs. Command**

The course will also examine the underlying structure of economies, specifically the conflict between **capitalist** and **command** models.

The **capitalist model**, in its purest **laissez-faire** form ("let it be"), involves individuals deciding what to produce and consume with no government interference – a purely free market. However, a purely capitalistic economy has never truly existed. Most economies, like the US, are **constrained capitalist economies**: market-driven, but with rules and constraints set by the government and social norms. Government regulations (like safety or emissions standards for cars) and taxes are examples of these constraints. The government acts like guides on a bowling lane, keeping the market "ball" on the lane but letting individuals make the decisions. European nations are often seen as more constrained capitalist economies with higher taxes and more government intervention, resulting in greater equality.

The opposite extreme is the **command economy**, where the government makes all production and allocation decisions. People do not decide what they get; the government decides. The Soviet Union was an example of an economy close to this model. The theory behind the command economy, tracing back to Karl Marx, is that the government can ensure the right goods are produced and distributed as fairly as possible, which they argue the market cannot be trusted to do.

However, in practice, command economies have problems:
*   It is too difficult for any government to make the enormous number of decisions required for production and allocation in a complex economy. This leads to misallocations, like producing too much of one good (e.g., bread in East Germany) and too little of another (e.g., cars).
*   Command economies inevitably lead to massive **corruption**. Giving a small group of people the power to decide who gets what makes it inherent in human nature for them to prioritize themselves.

This is why command economies, like the Soviet Union, ultimately collapsed; they simply couldn't function effectively.

The capitalist economy operates by what Adam Smith called the **invisible hand**. This is the idea that the market, through buyers and sellers interacting, can decide how much gets produced and who gets it without a central government making these decisions. This "magic of the market" can lead to the right goods being produced and getting into the hands of the right people. A huge advantage of the capitalist model is its success in driving economic growth and creating wealth, as seen in the US.

However, an inevitable outcome of a capitalist economy is tremendous **inequality**. In a market system, the "right person" to have a good is the person who can pay the most for it. In contrast, a command economy, ideally (corruption aside), would allocate goods to those who need them most. The US is noted as the most unequal major nation in the world, with the top 1% controlling a significant portion of income.

The consensus among economists is against the command economy. The debate lies within the capitalist model regarding how much government intervention is appropriate. This involves considering the trade-offs between a freer economy (potentially larger but with more inequality) and a less free economy (with less inequality).

The course will spend the first half on the standard economic model, including why the market equilibrium is often considered the best outcome. The second half will focus on situations where the standard model breaks down, exploring topics like monopolies, international trade, saving/work decisions, investment, and global warming.

Learning resources for the course include Lecture Notes (like handouts with graphs), Lecture Videos, Problem Sets with Solutions, and Exams with Solutions, available via MIT OpenCourseWare. The instructor encourages students to discuss concepts, economics in general, or the "big picture" questions.
